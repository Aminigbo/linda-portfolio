## Partnership with Traditional Rulers

Speaking during the presentation, Hon. Linda emphasized the importance of working closely with traditional rulers, describing them as critical partners in driving sustainable development and ensuring that empowerment initiatives reach the intended beneficiaries.

## Community Response and Expectations

Community leaders, youths, and women groups have applauded the initiative, describing it as a bold step toward improving livelihoods and fostering unity across Okrika communities. The scheme is expected to support small businesses, skill acquisition programs, and social welfare projects within the communities.

## Strategic Grassroots Development

By empowering community kings with significant funding and decision-making authority, Hon.
