# Hon. Linda Somiari-Stewart Launches "Project War Canoes of Economic Empowerment" in Okrika

In a historic and culturally significant event held on Saturday, January 4th, at Chukunibiri, Ogoloma in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State, Hon. Linda Somiari-Stewart, Deputy Leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly and Member representing Okrika Constituency, officially launched the groundbreaking "Project War Canoes of Economic Empowerment."

## Reviving Cultural Heritage

The initiative is designed to revive the socio-economic relevance of war canoe houses—long-standing pillars of Ijaw heritage—while promoting unity, economic growth, and sustainable development within the Okrika community.

Addressing an audience comprising traditional chiefs, war canoe house leaders, beneficiaries, and distinguished guests, Hon. Somiari-Stewart highlighted the deep historical and cultural importance of war canoe houses as symbols of resilience, collective strength, and economic cooperation.

## Empowering Through Tradition

"Our war canoe houses have long stood as symbols of resilience, collective strength, and economic cooperation. Today, we are strengthening the dream of our forefathers by empowering 30 individuals drawn from Chukunibiri's three constituent war canoe houses," she stated.

The project provides direct financial support to beneficiaries to engage in petty trading, traditional craftsmanship, and other economic ventures, with the goal of improving household incomes while strengthening the spirit of mutual support that has defined war canoe houses for generations.

## Leadership Support and Appreciation

Leaders of the three war canoe houses—Chief Earnest Afiesimama of Nangibo War Canoe House, Chief Barrister Iyala Somiari of Somiari War Canoe House, and Chief Barrister Tamunokuro Somiari of AmieJubodie War Canoe House—expressed deep appreciation for the initiative. They described the project as "a novel and timely intervention aimed at restoring the glory of war canoe houses," and pledged to establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure accountability and long-term success.

## Vision for Collective Prosperity

In her remarks, Hon. Somiari-Stewart emphasized the importance of collective responsibility in sustaining the project:

"A canoe moves forward only when all its paddlers row in harmony. Together, we can chart a path towards shared prosperity anchored in unity, hope, and mutual support."

She also called on well-meaning individuals and stakeholders to support the program under the structured supervision of war canoe house leadership. The Honourable member further assured the community of her commitment to sustaining the initiative and expanding it to other war canoe houses across Okrika Constituency.

## Immediate Impact

Each beneficiary was immediately credited with ₦100,000, targeted at supporting petty trading and traditional Ijaw crafts such as basket weaving and fish rack production. In their responses, beneficiaries expressed gratitude and pledged accountability to their war canoe chiefs and chairmen to ensure the success and credibility of the project.

The launch of Project War Canoes of Economic Empowerment marks a new chapter for Chukunibiri and the wider Okrika community—rekindling an age-old system of economic empowerment rooted in culture, unity, and shared prosperity.

## A Model for Cultural Economic Development

This innovative approach demonstrates how traditional institutions can be leveraged for modern economic development, creating a sustainable model that honors cultural heritage while addressing contemporary needs.
